Make a list of the layers that would need to be reproduced on their machine. (For example, a layer would be the version of R that you're using)\n\noptions(\"repos\") Run .libPaths()\n\n-   Hints:\n\n    -   Inspect your renv.lock file.\n    -   Where are your packages being pulled from? Confirm by typing `options(\"repos\")`.\n        -   You can modify your package repository by running `options(\"repos\" = c(\"<REPO-NAME>\" = \"https://your-repository-url.com\"))` in your RStudio console.\n    -   Visit the webpage where packages are being pulled from and see if you can identify package dependencies. Are packages downloaded as binaries or from source?\n    -   What are your server and OS dependencies? (If you are not sure which distribution of Linux you are using, you can find it by typing `cat /etc/*-release` in your terminal)\n\n-   In your day-to-day work, what's the hardest reproducibility challenge?\n:::\n\n## Packages vs. Libraries vs. Repositories\n\n**Package** - contains code, functions, data, and documentation. Can be be distributed as SOURCE (a directory with all package components), [BINARIES](https://solutions.posit.co/envs-pkgs/environments/repositories/index.html#binary-packages) (contains files in OS-specific format) or as a BUNDLE (compressed file containing package components, similar to source).\n\n**Library** - is a directory where packages are installed. You can have user-level or project-level libraries. Run `.libPaths()` to see yours. To use a package in has to be installed in a library with `install.packages()` and then loaded into memory with `library(x)` .\n\n**Repository** - a collection of packages. CRAN is a public external repository that is a network of servers that distribute R along with R packages.\n\n## Renv workflow\n\n![](images/Screenshot%202023-09-06%20at%208.31.22%20PM.png)\n\n::: notes\n1.  Use a version control system e.g.[git](https://git-scm.com/) with [GitHub](https://github.com/)\n\n2.  One user (perhaps yourself) should explicitly initialize `renv` in the project, via [`renv::init()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/init.html). This will create the initial `renv` lockfile, and also write the `renv` auto-loaders to the project's `.Rprofile` and `renv/activate.R`. These will ensure the right version of `renv` is downloaded and installed for your collaborators when they start in this project.\n\n3.  Using a branching strategy push your code alongside the generated lockfile `renv.lock`. Be sure to also share the generated auto-loaders in `.Rprofile` and `renv/activate.R`.\n\n4.  When a collaborator first launches in this project, `renv` should automatically bootstrap itself, thereby downloading and installing the appropriate version of `renv` into the project library. After this has completed, they can then use [`renv::restore()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/restore.html) to restore the project library locally on their machine.\n:::\n\n## Lab Activity\n\n🟥 - I need help\n\n🟨 - I'm still working\n\n🟩 - I'm done\n\nComplete Part 2 of Lab: Deploy Quarto with GHA including the exercises\n\n## Mechanisms for reproducibility\n\n\\*\\* make this a diagram starting from least to most reproducibility\n\n-   documenting state & version control\n\n-   virtual environments (`renv`, `venv`) + package management\n\n-   Containerization & docker\n\n-   Infrastructure as Code\n\n## Is version control secure?\n\n-   our code is still saved locally\n-   How do we make sure that the code we push to Github (or elsewhere) is secure?\n\n## A short auth teaser\n\n-   We can use a variety of data sharing \"transfer protocols\"\n-   protocols specify what kind of traffic is moving between 2 machines\n-   a port specifies where to direct the traffic\n\n| http    | https    | SSH     | git       |\n|---------|----------|---------|-----------|\n| port 80 | port 443 | port 22 | port 9418 |\n\n## Image of ports and how they work\n\n-   notes: A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end.

Docker images use something called layers which makes it super easy and quick to update. Layers start at a base layer which is usually the linux operating system and then they go up to the application layer. a container is the environment for a running process of an image - so if an image is running then its using a container instance. You can have multiple containers running at the same time. But once you delete it everything inside of it goes away.\n\nLet's see an example of what this looks like in practice. Lets say we need to use a postgres sql database for some testing - but we want to test using an older and a newer version of postgres.\n\nLets go to Dockerhub and search for it. We can see official images but there are also thousands of them created by people- hub only has images not dockerfiles or containers themselves. docker image ls - lets list all the images that we have docker pull postgres:12 - see how its pulling and extracting all these layers - but what if we want a newer version or what if we need to run both versions on our machine\n\ndocker pull postgres:latest - notice how some of these layers already exist so it takes a lot less time\n\nLets go on dockerhub and see if we can understand a bit more about the layers https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/postgres/12/images/sha256-a97fd76ab09599e2ddc15c90a87f9a4a2a60551d99f8e7397f12a1d606d7f0ab?context=explore -\n\nwe can see that there are a lot of layers but its hard to understand what exactly is happening - lets look at the dockerfile that shows us the recipe for postgres - this is usually saved in a [github](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/postgres/README.md) repo - not on dockerhub which is just images\n\nevery docker file starts with a from command - this is the base layers that starts the image, then we are running some things, copying , env variables, and starting\n\nlets run the image and see\n:::\n\n## Virtual Machine vs. Container\n\n![](images/Screenshot%202023-09-03%20at%209.56.54%20AM.png)\n\n::: notes\ncontainers are very lightweight which makes it really easy and quick to spin them up\n\nthis is because the container itself doesnt have a host operating system or any hardware - intel chip, apple chip etc - this is in the docker engine or runtime which we will look at in the architecture\n:::\n\n## Docker Architecture\n\n![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-30%20at%2011.31.56%20AM.png)\n\n::: notes\n-   Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon.\n\n-   The Docker client - is the primary way that users interface with Docker via CLI\n\n-   The Docker daemon does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers\n\n-   The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface.\n\n-   Registry is a Repository for Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub) where you can store and share images.\n\n-   Docker engine is a container runtime that runs on diffrent OS's. Set up the isolated environment for your container\n:::\n\n## Mode for running containers\n\n+------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Mode                                                       | Run command       | Use case                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n+============================================================+===================+====================================================================================================================================================================================================================+\n| Detached                                                   | `docker run -d`   | This runs the container in the **background** so the container keeps running until the application process exits, or you stop the container. Detached mode is often used for production purposes.                  |\n+------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Interactive + terminal                                     | `docker run -it`  | This runs the container in the **foreground** so you are unable to access the command prompt. Interactive mode is often used for development and testing.                                                          |\n+------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Remove everything once the container is done with its task | `docker run --rm` | This mode is used on foreground containers that perform **short-term tasks** such as tests or database backups. Once it is removed anything you may have downloaded or created in the container is also destroyed. |\n+------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n## Lab Activity\n\n🟥 - I need help\n\n🟨 - I'm still working\n\n🟩 - I'm done\n\nComplete Lab 2: Part 1\n\n## Container Debugging\n\n-   Interactive mode\n\n-   `docker exec`\n\n-   Logging\n\n```         \ndocker run -it -d ubuntu\ndocker container ls -a \ndocker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash\n\ndocker container run -d --name mydb \\\n --name mydb \\\n -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw \\ \n mysql\n \n docker container logs mydb\n```\n\n::: footer\n🔍 Live code\n:::\n\n## Lab Activity\n\n🟥 - I need help\n\n🟨 - I'm still working\n\n🟩 - I'm done\n\nComplete Lab 2: Part 2\n\n## Port Mapping with `docker run -p`\n\n```         \ndocker pull httpd:alpine\ndocker pull httpd:latest\n\ndocker inspect --format='{{.Config.ExposedPorts}}' httpd:latest\ndocker inspect --format='{{.Config.ExposedPorts}}' httpd:alpine\n\ndocker run -p DockerHostPort:ApplicationPort\n\ndocker run -d -p 81:80 --name httpd-latest httpd:latest\ncurl http://localhost:81\n\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 --name httpd-alpine httpd:alpine\ncurl http://localhost:80\n```\n\n::: footer\n🔍 Live code\n:::\n\n## Persisting data with Docker\n\nStateless vs. Stateful applications volume mount bind mount external storage shared file system\n\n## Putting it all together\n\nhttps://github.com/rstudio/rstudio-docker-products/blob/dev/docker-compose.yml\n\n::: notes\n-   **docker-compose:** A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.\n-   Uses a YAML file to define services, networks, and volumes.\n-   Simplifies the orchestration of complex applications.\n:::\n\n## Lab Activity\n\n🟥 - I need help\n\n🟨 - I'm still working\n\n🟩 - I'm done\n\nComplete Lab 2: Part 3 Complete Lab 2: Part 4\n\n## Building Docker Images\n\n-   Images are build using a Dockerfile or interactively \"on-the-fly\"\n\n-   Steps to version and share your images on Dockerhub (or a different repository)\n\nmake this a diagram Step 1: Commit Step 2: Tag Step 3: Push\n\n## Lab Activity\n\n🟥 - I need help\n\n🟨 - I'm still working\n\n🟩 - I'm done\n\nComplete Lab 2: Part 5\n\n## Dockerfile Build Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| FROM    |             |\n| ENV     |             |\n| COPY    |             |\n| RUN     |             |\n|         |             |\n|         |             |\n|         |             |\n\n## Dockerfile Example\n\nWalk through Posit Connect [Dockerfile](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio-docker-products/blob/dev/connect/Dockerfile.ubuntu2204)\n\n## Activity\n\nComplete Lab 2: Part 6\n\n## Part 4: Data Science in Production\n\n## Data Science in Production {.content-dark}\n\n-   Presentation Layer\n\n-   Processing Layer\n\n-   Data store Layer\n\n## Choosing the right presentation layer\n\n-   [Alex's flow chart](https://do4ds.com/chapters/sec1/1-2-proj-arch.html)\n\n-   credit text\n\n## Production \"State\"\n\nQuestions to ask once your content is able to be consumed by your intended audience\n\n-   Is it reproducible?\n\n-   Is it portable?\n\n-   Is it maintainable?\n\n-   Does it scale?\n\n-   Is your code efficiently written?\n\n-   Is it secure and accessible?\n\n-   Can you trust your code?\n\n## APIs can help\n\n-   RESTful APIs\n\n-   a way to access content by non-R users\n\n## Structure of an API\n\n## Activity: Create a Posit Connect API key\n\n-   login to Connect\n\n-   create connect key\n\n-   use rsconnect to access\n\n-   use curl to access\n\n## Creating an API\n\n-   plumber exercise\n\n## Securing your application\n\n-   SSL & https\n\n-   live code\n\n## Authentication vs. Authorization\n\n## Deploying and hosting your API\n\n## Activity\n\n-   deploy api to connect\n\n-   put shiny frontend and call api\n\n## Testing and logging\n\n## Activity\n\n-   add logging and test to shiny app (if there's time)\n\n## Activity\n\n-   add app to server\n\n## \n\n",
