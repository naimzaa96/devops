## Overview

In this workshop, we will discuss ways to better containerize, deploy,
and scale your data products.

Participants will get hands-on practice deploying:

\- A quarto site using Github Actions

\- An API via a Docker container

\- A Linux server running Posit products

By the end of the workshop you will have the tools to start deploying
your own data science assets into production.

This workshop is for you if you...

-   are a data scientist or analyst who wants to put their work into
    production,

-   want to learn a more about Docker containers and virtual machines,
    or

-   want to better understand importance of networking, security,
    storage, and different server architectures to deploying data apps.
