## Code of Conduct {.brackets-light}

https://posit.co/code-of-conduct/

## A very brief history

-   Development of system of practice in the late 2000's in software and IT online communities

-   Developers often siloed from operations teams resulting in inefficient processes

-   Long development cycles and monolithic environments made it difficult to quickly iterate and deploy

-   Microservices architectures become more popular

-   Software stacks used different languages, frameworks, databases

-   Devops built on agile methodologies used in software dev and extended it to operations

-   Early leaders such as Gene Kim, ..

-   Movement to integrate security into devops cycles

## Principles of Devops {.toc-people-dark}

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-29%20at%203.32.37%20PM.png){width="276"}

**DevOps** is a combination of software development (dev) and operations (ops). It is defined as a software engineering methodology which aims to integrate the work of development teams and operations teams by facilitating a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility.

-   Collaboration

-   Automation

-   CI/CD

-   Rapid feedback loops

-   Culture change

## Why should data scientists/analysts care about devops?

-   Building and delivering software includes models, visualizations, data transformations & data applications

-   Practices such as automation, collaboration, testing, and iterative improvement can dramatically improve data work and improve reproducibility

-   Developers of code are often also asked to help "operationalize" their code

-   Improve collaboration & communication with engineering, ops, IT, and security teams

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-22%20at%203.26.22%20PM.png)

## Has this ever happened to you?

::: incremental
-   You come back to code from a year ago and now it doesnt run!

-   Your boss asks you to share that Shiny app with a client but the dev team is too busy working on their roadmap to help you deploy it somewhere.

-   You need to share your prediction model (created in R) with the Engineering team but they only code in Java.

What other problems have you ran into that could possibly be solved with devops practices or tools?

## Data Science in Production {.content-dark}

Production is both **a** a **state of being** and a **process** for "deploying" content

## Environments

Content is deployed (and code is promoted) across different environments with different intended audiences

## Power of YAML

-   allows you to configure different arguments so your code is DRY

-   human friendly language for data

-   Many tools include yaml auto-completion (including quarto)

-   everything is a key value pair and interpreted as maps or dictionaries

-   used across many execution environments including Docker, virtual machines, etc

``` yaml
environment: prod
```

## YAML example

```{yaml}

--- # start of YAML document

# - used for comments

#string

name: "Rika Gorn"

# https://github.com/sd031/yaml-crash-course/blob/main/full_example.yaml


```

## Production "State"

Questions to ask once your content is able to be consumed by your intended audience

-   Is it reproducible?

-   Is it portable?

-   Is it maintainable?

-   Does it scale?

-   Is your code efficiently written?

-   Is it secure and accessible?

-   Can you trust your code?

## Packages vs. Libraries vs. Repositories

**Package** - contains code, functions, data, and documentation. Can be be distributed as SOURCE (a directory with all package components), [BINARIES](https://solutions.posit.co/envs-pkgs/environments/repositories/index.html#binary-packages) (contains files in OS-specific format) or as a BUNDLE (compressed file containing package components, similar to source).

**Library** - is a directory where packages are installed. You can have user-level or project-level libraries. Run `.libPaths()` to see yours. To use a package in has to be installed in a library with `install.packages()` and then loaded into memory with `library(x)` .

**Repository** - a collection of packages. CRAN is a public external repository that is a network of servers that distribute R along with R packages.

## Activity

-   Complete Part 2 of Lab: Deploy Quarto with GHA including the exercises

-   In your day-to-day work, what's the hardest reproducibility challenge?

## Mechanisms for reproducibility

-   **documenting state & version control**

-   virtual environments

-   Containerization & Docker

-   Infrastructure as Code

## Collaborating with `renv`

1.  Use a version control system e.g.¬†[git](https://git-scm.com/) with [GitHub](https://github.com/)

2.  One user (perhaps yourself) should explicitly initialize `renv` in the project, via [`renv::init()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/init.html). This will create the initial `renv` lockfile, and also write the `renv` auto-loaders to the project's `.Rprofile` and `renv/activate.R`. These will ensure the right version of `renv` is downloaded and installed for your collaborators when they start in this project.

3.  Using a branching strategy push your code alongside the generated lockfile `renv.lock`. Be sure to also share the generated auto-loaders in `.Rprofile` and `renv/activate.R`.

4.  When a collaborator first launches in this project, `renv` should automatically bootstrap itself, thereby downloading and installing the appropriate version of `renv` into the project library. After this has completed, they can then use [`renv::restore()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/restore.html) to restore the project library locally on their machine.

## A short auth teaser

How do we make sure that the code we push to Github (or elsewhere) is secure?

We can use a variety of data sharing "transfer protocols"

| Local | Https (and http) | SSH | git |

## Github Actions Workflow

-   A github action allows us to create workflows that are triggered by a github action such as a push or pull to a branch

-   Workflows can include tests, markdown renders, shell scripts, or deployments. They can be as simple or as complicated as you need. Open-source community provides a ton of examples of actions.

-   Open source collection of "available" actions

- Runs on a seprate server called a runner

## Steps to deploy your site

1.  Use renv to maintain consistency between the development and build environments.

2.  Create a Connect API key

3.  Use rsconnect package to register your Connect server (directly or in your yaml)

4.  Add your API Key and Server URL to secrets in your Github repository

5.  Create a manifest.json

6.  Create your yaml in .github/workflows/ using actions and scripts (make sure to remove your .Rprofile!)

7.  Run your deployment!

8.  Monitor your action on github for failures

## APIs can help

-   RESTful APIs

-   a way to access content by non-R users

## When to use an API

## When not to use an API

## Structure of an API

## API frameworks

## Deploying an API

## Activity

API lab - use plumber to deploy prediction model to Connect

play around with other deploy methods

## Introduction to Docker

- open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications
- portable tool that allows you to package and application and its dependencies in a unit called a container

## Problems Docker Solves
- **Consistency:** Containers ensure that applications run the same way across different environments.
- **Isolation:** Containers isolate applications and their dependencies, preventing conflicts.
- **Portability:** Containers can run on any system that supports Docker, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.

## Lifecycle

## Containers & Docker

## Docker Workflow

## VM vs. Docker

## Parts of a Dockerfile

## Activity

-   Use either docker desktop or docker classroom

-   Create dockerfile to Deploy Shiny Open Source

-   Create shiny frontend to prediction API and add to server

## Principle 3: Is it secure?

## Auth section

## Linux Refresher (optional) {.toc-people-dark}

## Why Linux? {.brackets-light}

-   GNU+Linux kernel is one of the world's most popular operating systems
    -   It's used in the Mars Perseverance Rover!
-   It's open source and freely available
-   Different distributions available
-   Potentially less exploitable and more secure

## Terminology

-   The command line is a way to interact with a computer by typing text-based instructions to it, and reading the responses.
-   The software---called an interpreter---that translates your input into commands and executes them for you is the shell.
-   A *terminal* is an input and output environment that presents a text-only window running a shell.
-   A *shell* is a program that exposes the computer's operating system to a user or program. In Linux systems, the shell presented in a terminal is a command line interpreter.
-   A *command line interface* is a user interface (managed by a command line interpreter program) which processes commands to a computer program and outputs the results.
-   On most Linux distributions, the default shell is Bash, or Zsh.
